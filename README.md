### **Advanced Python Shell with Built-in MongoDB-like Data Type**

**Overview:**
This project involves creating an enhanced Python shell environment that supports traditional data types and commands while introducing a custom-built data type that emulates the functionality of MongoDB's BSON types. This new data type integrates seamlessly with Python's existing data structures, providing additional flexibility and features for data manipulation.

**Features:**

1. **Custom Data Type Integration:** The shell introduces a novel data type that mirrors MongoDB's BSON (Binary JSON) types. This built-in datatype allows users to work with complex data structures efficiently, leveraging capabilities similar to those found in MongoDB.

2. **Extended Shell Functionality:** Beyond the standard Python shell commands, this environment includes extended functionality for handling the new data type. Users can interact with this type using familiar syntax and operations.

3. **Advanced Parsing and Validation:** The shell features robust parsing functions to handle various data formats and ensure valid input. Functions like `nextComma`, `nextBrace`, and `keyValuePair` handle complex data structures, including lists and dictionaries.

4. **Enhanced Error Handling:** The shell provides detailed error messages for invalid operations or inputs, ensuring users receive clear feedback and guidance.

5. **Built-in Functions:** In addition to Python's native functions, the shell includes specialized built-in functions like `_type`, `_len`, `_int`, `_list`, and `_float`, tailored to work with the new data type and enhance data manipulation capabilities.

**Usage:**
Users can interact with the shell by executing Python commands and leveraging the new data type for advanced data operations. The shell supports variable assignments, type validations, and data manipulations, making it a powerful tool for developers working with complex data structures.

**Technical Details:**
- **Language:** Python
- **Key Libraries:** `re`, `keyword`, `colorama`
- **Features Implemented:** Custom data type handling, advanced parsing, built-in functions, extended shell commands

This project represents a significant advancement in Python shell environments, offering enhanced data manipulation capabilities and a richer user experience.
